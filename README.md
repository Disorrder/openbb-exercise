Two groups of questions, the first section is related to recursion and how to render elements in react. The second group is related to data fetching and rendering.

# First section

1. Make a function to transform the dictionary in the file `utils/tailmap.json` and returns an array of dictionaries recursively. example of final output is in file `utils/solution.json`. You can do it on the file `utils/transform.js`

2. Make react component to render this recursively (Bonus: lazy load the elements that are not visible on the screen). If you could not complete the first solution you can use the array from `utils/solution.json`. You can use the component already created on `components/Trailmap.js` and already imported on `pages/index.js`

# Second section

1. Now imagine this dictionary (/or array) comes from a content managed system (CMS), outline the steps you would need to fetch the data and render it in react and the code for it. (Bonus: outline how you can make the page always render fast)
